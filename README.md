The Complex Calculator is a calculator I have created in Secondary 4 using C++ on my free time.

The calculator can add, subtracts, multiplies, and divides 2 complex numbers (i.e. a+bi when a,b are real numbers and i = sqrt(-1)).
Additionally, the calculator can also calculate the n-th power and the n-th root of a complex number (when n is a natural number).

This project demonstrates my ability to use data structures (mainly pairs) and also some algorithms such as recursions.
Do note that I mainly do competitive programming and have achieved a bronze medal in NOI 2023.
